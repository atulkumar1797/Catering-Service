<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>In collaboration with our customers we work closely to understand their precise needs. Working within the ethnic and cultural environment, we tailor a flexible and transparent solution that enables customers to scale services to meet ever changing needs.

Integrated Solutions:
We also offer a range of other services such as Security Services, Support Services, Property Services, Cleaning Services and Facility Management Services. These services can be delivered individually or as integrated solutions. Integrated Facility Services combines all the customers� services into a single solution, where one service area can support other service areas to ensure efficiency and optimize service delivery. For example, reception services can easily be combined with catering services, with the employee seamlessly switching roles from front desk to the kitchen. 

From the customers point of view, by harnessing synergies between services we create cost efficiency within the organization, complying with the Service Level Agreement according to the customer�s demands. With our vast global operational experience and ability to serve several different segments, ISS is clearly a unique and distinguishable company.

With variations of customers come varied customer needs. To provide such differential customers with the best possible service requires a pool of values and know-how which are combined to match each individual customer's needs and requirements.</p>

<h2>Benefites Of Booking Us</h2>
</p>We approach to Facility Management combines all the customer�s services into an integrated solution. By bundling services we are able to reduce overheads and allocate resources more efficiently. 

For example, combining site-based services with periodical off-site deliveries for optimising efficiency e.g. energy management or ad-hoc services such as event-catering, planned maintenance or security installations. The synergy comes from our ability to integrate services and optimise delivery systems. 

The ability to integrate and self-deliver services is the key to providing cost-effective workflows and high-quality service. For the customer, this creates cost efficiency within the organisation and complies with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) according to the customer�s demands. The ISS approach to FM is through an integrated model where services are delivered through a seamless integration of people, processes and systems. 

For international contracts, we combine this with our cross-border management structure to allow service optimisation and benchmarking. Partnering with ISS means consolidating subcontractors to a single point of contact with one service provider for all services rendered.
